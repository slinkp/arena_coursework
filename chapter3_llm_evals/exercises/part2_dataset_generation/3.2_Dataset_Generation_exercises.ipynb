It assigns each run of the function to a separate CPU core or \"worker\", each executes the function on its own \"thread\". This will greatly increase the speed of generating a large number of questions. For a more detailed tutorial, see [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/191nobMLWeaCAB6i5gQJ3We0qcPjvu_dM?usp=sharing) - note that concurrency is a very deep topic in programming that we'll barely scratch the surface of here.\n",

You can find more documentation on `executor.map()` [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html).\n",

        "Run the code below to see how it works for a simple example function. You should see that the first three calls to `add_numbers` are executed concurrently (in approximately 2 seconds), but the 4th is executed in 4 seconds - this is because we have `max_workers=3`, so one of the first three computations has to be finished before the 4th can be started.\n",

If the task is CPU-bottlenecked (e.g. data processing or encryption) then you should generally not use more workers than you have CPU cores (you can find this with the `os.cpu_count()` function). However in our case (querying from an LLM API), the task is I/O (input-output) bottlenecked, and so we don't really need to worry about this as an upper bound. The main considerations are **system network capacity** and most importantly **API rate limits** - if you start hitting rate limit errors, that's when you should be decreasing the number of workers. We recommend using a conservative value in the range of 6-10.\n",
