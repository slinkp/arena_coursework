Also don't worry too much if the `system` and `reasoning` fields aren't used as you would expect - later on we'll learn how to construct datasets in a much better way, which appropriately uses all of these fields."

        "A main flaw of model-generated questions is the lack of diversity. The questions might follow the same format and a bit cookie-cutter, whereas ideally, we want a heterogenous set of questions so the style pattern is not a confounder to our results.\n",
        "\n",
        "One solution to this problem is to add **variance prompts**. These are additional instructions we design to add to the user prompt, for the purpose of introducing variations in its responses. They can instruct the model to generate questions about a particular context, or be more creative. Some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"Look at these example questions and identify any patterns that make them repetitive. Then think of different kinds of questions that break these patterns.\"\n",

        "- \"Make your questions really simple and straightforward.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea isn't to uniformly improve questions, but rather provide more different question archetypes. You should fill in the `add_variance_prompts` function below, which randomly selects and appends these variance prompts to the user prompt with some probability `p_var` (i.e. with this probability we select exactly one of the variance prompts uniformly at random and append it to the user prompt).\n",
        "\n",
        "When you've finished the function, you should run the code below to experiment with different variance prompts, and make sure they increase diversity without significantly reducing the quality of model output. Importantly, note how we need to make sure each question is generated from a different sample of the variance prompts, otherwise the whole point of using variance prompts for increased diversity is lost."

        "\n",
        "One tool that massively aids us during evals work is **concurrency** (multiple computations happening at once). Since most of our code is bottlenecked by waiting to receive responses from the LLM, we could in theory send multiple requests at once without having to wait for each one to be fully returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "`ThreadPoolExecutor` is a set of functions in Python's `concurrent.future` module that allows functions to be executed concurrently. It assigns each run of the function to a separate CPU core or \"worker\", each executes the function on its own \"thread\". This will greatly increase the speed of generating a large number of questions. For a more detailed tutorial, see [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/191nobMLWeaCAB6i5gQJ3We0qcPjvu_dM?usp=sharing) - note that concurrency is a very deep topic in programming that we'll barely scratch the surface of here.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic syntax for using `ThreadPoolExecutor` that we'll be using is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:\n",
        "    results = executor.map(function_to_execute, input_args)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, `function_to_execute` could be a function that queries the LLM, and `input_args` could be a list of different prompts to query with. The `results` object will be an iterator containing the results of each function call. You can find more documentation on `executor.map()` [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the code below to see how it works for a simple example function. You should see that the first three calls to `add_numbers` are executed concurrently (in approximately 2 seconds), but the 4th is executed in 4 seconds - this is because we have `max_workers=3`, so one of the first three computations has to be finished before the 4th can be started.\n",

        "<summary>How to choose <code>max_workers</code></summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "Partly this depends on the nature of your task. If the task is CPU-bottlenecked (e.g. data processing or encryption) then you should generally not use more workers than you have CPU cores (you can find this with the `os.cpu_count()` function). However in our case (querying from an LLM API), the task is I/O (input-output) bottlenecked, and so we don't really need to worry about this as an upper bound. The main considerations are **system network capacity** and most importantly **API rate limits** - if you start hitting rate limit errors, that's when you should be decreasing the number of workers. We recommend using a conservative value in the range of 6-10.\n",

        "Now that we've established a pipeline for generation & scoring, we're finally ready to take the last step in today's exercises, and generate a quality-controlled question set of 300 questions! This will involve an iterative process that looks something like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Iteratively generate & score a small number of questions (e.g. 20) and inspect the results.\n",
        "- If the scores are not good quality, update `RUBRIC` & `SCORING_EXAMPLES` to fix the issue you've spotted.\n",
        "- If the questions are not good quality, update the generation prompts to fix the issue you've spotted.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's no code for you to fill in below - instead we've given you the function `generate_and_score_questions` which combines together a lot of code from the last few exercises to do a single operation that generates, scores, and saves questions. Your job is to run the cell below, and then interpret the results & use them to iterate on & improve your generation & scoring prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notes / guidance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- This iterative process should take a while, which is why we've given your `generate_and_score_questions` function a `version` argument for saving files at different paths. You should increment this version number each time you run the cell below, and make sure you're keeping track of the improvements you're making.\n",
        "- Use the `summarize_results` function to better understand and interpret the results you're getting - you can always go back and add to this function if you decide there are some more features you want it to have!\n",
        "- As well as updating the prompt templates, don't forget to add to the few-shot examples with more examples of good and bad questions (with unusual failure modes). Remember that you can edit a question that the model creates before you add it to the examples list, you don't have to take it exactly as given.\n",
        "- Make sure you don't overfit to your rubric - even if all questions are getting 10/10, can you evaluate the questions and see issues in them which the rubric isn't catching?\n",
        "- We recommend you start with a small number of generated questions, to keep the feedback loops short & API costs low. Something like 5-10 should give you a good signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eventually when you're happy with your generation & scoring prompts, you should proceed to the final code cell, which creates a list of ~300 questions which score highly on the rubric and which you're happy with - **they will be used as we go into tomorrow's exercises!**"
