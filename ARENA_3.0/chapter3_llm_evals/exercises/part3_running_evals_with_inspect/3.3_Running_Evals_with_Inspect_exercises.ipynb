    "This section will introduce you to the process of running an evaluation using the `Inspect` library. This is a library that has been built by UK AISI for ease-of-use, and to standardise LLM evaluations. In this section, we'll actually get to run an evaluation on large language models, and notice the choices that can be made in eval design (how questions are presented, whether the model can use CoT, whether we use many-shot, few-shot, or zero-shot prompting etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to [3.1] and [3.2], most of our solutions will be built around the example **tendency to seek power** dataset. So you should approach the exercises with this in mind. You can either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the same dataset as the solutions, and implement the evals that we run in the solutions. You could also extend this, and come up with your own evaluation procedure on this dataset.\n",
    "2. Use your own dataset for your chosen model property. For this, you will have to work through sections [3.1] and [3.2] and have a dataset of ~300 questions to use when you evaluate the LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!"

The collection of solvers is also sometimes called the `plan`.\n",

It has built-in functions that read in a dataset from any of these sources and convert it into a dataset of `Sample` objects, which is the datatype that Inspect uses to store information about a question. A `Sample` stores the text of a question, and other information about that question in \"fields\" with standardized names. The most important fields of the `Sample` object are:\n",

    "\\*If you didn't finish yesterday's exercises or aren't happy with your dataset, you can use the dataset `power-seeking_300_qs.json` which was saved by us as an example. However this dataset uses the most basic form of the prompt templates as they were presented to you in yesterday's exercises without any iteration (you can inspect the dataset yourself to see how basic and error-prone it is), so we strongly recommend using your own dataset if possible!"

If this was a multiple choice question then we could use the simple `match` (which checks whether the model's answer matches the target).

    "Scorers are what the inspect library uses to judge model output. We use them to determine whether the model's answer is the `target` answer. From the [inspect documentation](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/scorers.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Scorers generally take one of the following forms:\n",
    "> 1. Extracting a specific answer out of a model’s completion output using a variety of heuristics.\n",
    "> 2. Applying a text similarity algorithm to see if the model’s completion is close to what is set out in the target.\n",
    "> 3. Using another model to assess whether the model’s completion satisfies a description of the ideal answer in target.\n",
    "> 4. Using another rubric entirely (e.g. did the model produce a valid version of a file format, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are writing a multiple choice benchmark, for our purposes we can either use the `match()` scorer, or the `answer()` scorer. The docs for these scorer functions can be found [here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/scorers.html#built-in-scorers) (and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/c59ce86b9785495338990d84897ccb69d46610ac/src/inspect_ai/scorer/_match.py) in the `inspect_ai` github).

    "- `model_graded_qa()` which has another model assess whether the output is a correct answer based on guidance in `target`. This is especially useful for evals where the answer is more open-ended. Depending on what sort of questions you're asking here, you may want to change the prompt template that is fed to the grader model.\n",

    "## Loading Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can finalize our evaluation task, we'll need to modify our `record_to_sample` function from earlier. There are two issues with the function we wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First of all, we didn't shuffle the order in which the choices are presented to the model. Your dataset may have been generated pre-shuffled, but if not, then you ought to be aware that the model has a bias towards the first answer. See for example [Narayanan & Kapoor: Does ChatGPT have a Liberal Bias?](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/does-chatgpt-have-a-liberal-bias) To mitigate this confounder, we should shuffle the choices (and answer) around when loading in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>Aside: Inspect's built-in shuffle function</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect comes with a shuffle function for multiple choice questions. However, this function then automatically \"unshuffles\" *only* some of the model's responses back to how they are presented in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure there are use cases for this, but in our case it's unnecessarily confusing to see the model reasoning about e.g. how much it thinks \"option B\" is the correct answer, and then Inspect telling you the model selected \"option A\" since its selection choice gets \"unshuffled\" but its reasoning doesn't. For this reason, and because it's not very hard to do, we will just build our own shuffler that doesn't do any unshuffling to any part of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, our original `record_to_sample` function can only load questions with the corresponding system prompt. It is often useful to load the dataset without a system prompt. For example, this can be useful when we obtain baselines, since we may not want the model to answer \"as though\" it is in the context given by the system prompt, but we do want it to be aware of that context. We also may want to load without a system prompt when running an evaluation, so we can see how the model reacts to our questions when presented with a more generic \"You are a harmless, helpful, honest AI Chat Assistant\" system prompt (which we can then provide with our `system_message` solver)."

For example suppose our system prompt told the model it was a school principal deciding how to use funds - we _don't_ want the model to actually act like a school principal, but we _do_ want the model to understand that _it is being asked to evaluate the behaviour of a school principal_.\n",

In other words, your prompt (in shorthand) should look something like `\"Given question X with choices Y, reason step-by-step on which choice you think is more indicative of target behaviour Z.\"`, where `Z` is the target behaviour for the dataset you've been using.\n",

    "    - This will require you to write & test some more specialized template prompts, rather than using only the ones we've already defined for you above. If you're stuck then we recommend looking at the dropdown to see what the eventual messages look like (in the Inspect log viewer).\n",

We could easily run it on every model we want to evaluate all at once, however this would take a substantial amount of time, and the cost would be hard to predict. Before running it on larger models, test that everything works on `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, as this is by far the cheapest model currently available (and surprisingly capable)!\n",
